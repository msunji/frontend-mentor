## Overview

For this challenge, users must be able to view the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size. Also, they need to see a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

I started working on the mobile version first before scaling up to the desktop version. Initially started off with flexbox, but opted to go with CSS grid instead. I found `grid-template-areas` to be pretty useful in this case.
