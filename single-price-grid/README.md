# Frontend Mentor: Single price grid component

## Overview

For this challenge, users must be able to view the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size. Also, they need to see a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

This is what the project looks like on desktop:

While this is what it looks like on smaller screens:

I started working on the mobile version first before scaling up to the desktop version. Initially started off with flexbox, but opted to go with CSS grid instead. `Grid-template-areas` are pretty useful in this case.
